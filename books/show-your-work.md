# A new way of operating

Despite agreeing with the famous advice from the Comedian Steve Martin, "Be so good they can't ignore you", the author has another perspective, "But it's not enough to be good. In order to be found, you have to be findable." He believes putting the works out there and making them discoverable is also easy to do alongside trying to be good.

Lots of people are actively developing their skills but instead of just privately putting in the hours, they openly share their works to other people. By sharing their ideas & knownledge, they often gain much more than just audiences, the book is the author's method to "self-promote" the easy way.

# You don't have to be a genius
## Find a scenius

Brian Eno refers "sceniuses" as not just geniuses creating their works along but a group of people supporting, inspiring, teaching each other behind the scene, so creativity is always a collaboration. It leaves room for non-genius, we can stop thinking about how not-smart we are but focus about how we can (now more easily) contribute and influent each other's work.

## Be an amateur

Amateurs are willing to try anything and share the results, they don't hesitate to do the works that others will think that they're stupid, they'll use whatever tools they can get their hands on to get their ideas into the world. "... You can move from mediocre to good in increaments. The real gap is between doing nothing and doing something." - Clay Shirky in Cognitive Surplus.

Amateurs lean in the open, others can learn from their failures and successes. Starting by committing to learn something in front of others. Find a scenius & pay attention on what they're NOT sharing, look for empty space that you can fill, no matter how bad they can be at first. "Share what you love,, and the people who love the same things will find you."

## You can't find your voice if you don't use it

If your work isn't online, it doesn't exist. They only way to find your voice is to use it, talk about the things you love, and your voice will follow.

## Read obituaries

Near-death experience might bring a new perspective into a person's life. However instead of hoping for a near-death experience, read the obituaries, take inspiration from them, they all started out as amateurs.

# Think process, not products
# Take people behind the scenes

In all kind of work, there is a distinction between the work, and the process in making the work. In the old age, people were limited on how they can share their process, and motive to keep their methods secret. In the mordern day, there are easier to share whatever we want to share, and people are interested in other people, what other people do. "By putting things out there, consistently, you can form a relationship with your customers. It allows them to see the person behind the products."

## Become a documentarian of what you do

Whatever you're doing, there's something interesting that people will be interested in, if only you present it in the interesting way. Sharing the process might be the the most valuable if the results of your works aren't easy to share or showcase.

"The first step is to scoop up the scraps and the residue of your process and shape them into some interesting but of media that you can share." Take documentaries of what you do, write your thoughs into a notebook, take photographs of the works at different stages, shoot videos of them. Keep track of what's going on around you, and take advantage of your tools - smartphones. 

Even if you don't share the process, you will still be able to see the work more clearly and feel like you're making progress. When you're ready to share something to the world, you have a lot of materials to choose from.

# Share something small every day
## Send out a daily dispatch

There's no overnight success, usually overnight successes are the results of years, if not life-long of hard works; Focus on days. Once a day, review your documentatin on your work and find a piece of your process that you can share.

If you're in early stage, share the influences and inspiration; developing stage: share the methods, or works in progress; completed stage: show the final products, residues left behind, or what you've learned; If you have lots of on-going projects, report on how they're doing. 

What you share doesn't matter, the daily dispatch can be anything you want - blog post, email, tweet, etc. Don't worry about being on every platform, pick and choose based on what you do and the people you're trying to reach, and don't be afraid of new platforms.

Stick to the question "What are you working on?" Don't worry about making them perfect, you don't know what's goiod and what sucks, let your audiences decide, watch their reaction.

Don't say that you don't have time, find the time that works for you. "You find time the same place you find spare change: in the nook and crannies." You find it in the cracks between the big stuffs - your commute, lunch breaks, etc.

## The "so what?" test

Ideally you want the things you share to also be shared and spread over the internet, so don't overshare, don't post things that you're not ready for the world to see. You're sharing things because you think that it might be helpful or entertaining to your audiences.

"Always be sure to run everything you share with others through the 'So What?' test." Make sure it's helpful, or entertaining, or it's ok if my boss, my mother sees it. If you're unsure, let it sit, save it for later to evaluate.

## Turn your flow into stock

"Flow is the feed. It's the posts and the tweets. It's the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that remind people you exist. Stock is the durable stuff. It's the content you produce that's an interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It's what people discover via search. It's what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time" - Robin Sloan. Maintain your flow while working on your stock in the background.

The stock is best made by collecting, organizing, and expanding upon the flow. After making the habit of sharing daily dispatch, you will notice themes, trends, and patterns. After detecting the patterns, you can collect the small pieces and turn them into something bigger - the stock.

## Build a good (domain) name

You should own your own place to share your works, where you can have total control of, and no one can take it away from you. A blog is a great way to get started, if you don't know how, there are lots of web designers available to help.

The website isn't just a promotion machine, it will become you on the internet. Slowly fill it with stuffs you want to share, build a good domain name, keep it clean, and eventually it will pay off.

# Open up your cabinet of curiosities
## Don't be a hoarder

To be honest, I don't fully understand this section, however I think this is what it means. The things you collect also define who you are, the inspirations, the things you read, watch, listen to, etc, also convey your taste. Before you're comfortable sharing your own works, sharing your collection is also an option.

## No guilty pleasures

Don't give up on the things you love but others think they're garbage, don't let anyone else make you feel bad. What makes us unique is the diversity and breadth of our incluences, being open and honest about what you like is the best way to connect with others who like the things you like.

## Credit is always due

It's always required for you to give proper credits, "... share the works of others as if it were your own, treadting it with respect and care." Failing to give proper credits you not only rob the original creator but also undermine the audiences you are sharing with, without credits, people won't be able to find more information about the work (that they might like).

Provide context for the things you are sharing: what is it, who/how/when/where/why made it, why you share it, etc. Another form people usually miss is where we found the work that we're sharing. Shout-out to whoever shared the work before you that let you know about it, and also leave a trail that your audiences can also follow for their inspiration. Include a link directly to the work, no one is gonna spend a Google search to find the original source.

Don't share things you can't credit, credit the work, or don't share it at all.

# Tell good stories
## Work doesn't speak for itself

"My work speaks for itself", no it doesn't. People want to know things about the work that you're sharing, the story you tell your audience effect how they feel about and understand the work, which effect how they value it. "... you need to become a better storyteller. You need to know what a good story is and how to tell one."

## Structure is everything

Structure is important, it should be tidy, sturdy, and logical; but sometime it's hard to have a good structure. 
Fairy tale structure: "Once upon a time, there was ... Every day, ... Because of that, ... Because of that... Until finally, ..."
Author John Gardner: "A character wants something, goes after it despite opposition (perhaps incluiding his own doubs), and so arrives at a win, lose or draw." This structure fit more on most of the creative works.
Usually we don't know the end of our story, the three act can help: The first act is the past (what/why/how you want); The second act is where you are at the moment; The third act is the future.

Keep your audience in mind, value their time and your time.
