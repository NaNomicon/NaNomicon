# A new way of operating

Despite agreeing with the famous advice from the Comedian Steve Martin, "Be so good they can't ignore you", the author has another perspective, "But it's not enough to be good. In order to be found, you have to be findable." He believes putting the works out there and making them discoverable is also easy to do alongside trying to be good.

Lots of people are actively developing their skills but instead of just privately putting in the hours, they openly share their works to other people. By sharing their ideas & knownledge, they often gain much more than just audiences, the book is the author's method to "self-promote" the easy way.

# You don't have to be a genius
## Find a scenius

Brian Eno refers "sceniuses" as not just geniuses creating their works along but a group of people supporting, inspiring, teaching each other behind the scene, so creativity is always a collaboration. It leaves room for non-genius, we can stop thinking about how not-smart we are but focus about how we can (now more easily) contribute and influent each other's work.
